# Genetics & Epigenetics Data Science Working Group

Welcome to the **Genetics & Epigenetics (G&E) Data Science Working Group** repository!  

This repository contains all lecture slides, workshop materials, and example code from our ongoing data science education series.

## Workshop Index

Each workshop is hosted in its own repository so you can clone and run just the workshop you need.

## About Us

The G&E Data Science Working Group is a student-led initiative aimed at helping **Master’s and PhD GSBS students** build practical computational and analytical skills. 

Our mission is to make data science more approachable, collaborative, and directly applicable to biological research.

We host a mix of:

- **Lectures** on core data science concepts  
- **Hands-on workshops** using R, Python, and common analysis frameworks  

All materials generated for these events will be archived here.

## What You’ll Find Here

- 📂 **Lecture slides** (PDF or PowerPoint)  
- 📁 **Workshop code** (R scripts, Python notebooks, datasets)  
- 📝 **Example workflows** for common biomedical data science tasks  
- 🔗 **Links to additional resources** shared during sessions  

Each session has its own repository containing all relevant files.

## Who This Repository Is For

This repository is designed for:

- GSBS graduate students (MS and PhD)  
- Rotation students and incoming trainees wanting to build computational skills  
- Researchers looking for accessible introductions to data science  
- Anyone interested in applying quantitative methods to biomedical research problems  

No prior coding or statistics experience is required—materials range from introductory to intermediate.
